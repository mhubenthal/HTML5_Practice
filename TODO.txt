Site TODOs:

1. Make URLs pretty.
2. Banner ad currently uses a CSS3 transition on "hover", implement for a mouse click.
3. Make columns finish at same bottom edge (instead of current ragged bottom edge).
4. Make section links active(i.e. bold) for the current section.
5. Include a "<figcaption>" element to caption the media elements.
6. Remove "<figure>[NO MEDIA]</figure>" placeholders from HTML.
